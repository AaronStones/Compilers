FOR LINUX BASED OS
-this system has been designed to operate with a Linux based OS
-to run the code navigate to the prettyAwful directory this will have the makefile in it
-type make into the command line
-if there are any issues it is usually because of a gcc error
	-sudo apt-get update
	-sudo apt install yum
	-sudo apt update
	-sudo apt install gcc - or update
	-sudo apt-get install build essential
	-this should fix the error

-the code will run when you use ./compiler <FILENAME>

FOR WINDOWS BASED OS
-there are a few more hoops to jump through for this 

-I would highly recommend installing ubuntu from the microsoft store - it installs 
	a linux shell on top of windows
-create a linux account with this - you will need to enable wsl on windows
-sudo apt-get update
-sudo apt install yum
-sudo apt update
-sudo apt install gcc - or update
-sudo apt-get install build essential
-this should fix the error

-navigate to the prettyAwful directory and run make 
-the code will run when you use ./compiler <FILENAME>
